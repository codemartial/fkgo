* Contemporary Language Issues

* Stylistic Convergence

C++, Java, Python, PHP, Ruby

- Similar way of doing OOP
- Similar way of code organisation
- Similar concurrent programming constructs
- Proliferation of "design patterns"

* Productivity vs Performance Tradeoff

- Dynamic Typed, Interpreted languages for Productivity
- Static Typed, Compiled languages for Performance
- True Parallelism is Impossible or Hard

* Feature Bloat

- Too many concepts
- Behavioural Exceptions and Edge Cases
- Dialects around custom subsets
- Variance in levels of understanding â‡’ Resident `$language` experts

* Ageing Infrastructure

- Profiling, testing, debugging as afterthoughts
- Complex support for Unicode
- Patchy support for multi-core, parallel programming
- Compex build systems
- Dependency abuse

* Readability and Maintenance

- Inline mixing of styles
- Adherence to common style is hard
- Dialects hurt speed, depth of comprehension
- Over-dependence on IDEs
- Deeply entrenched [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yo-yo_problem][Yo-yo Problem]]

* Programmer vs. Developer

Do you like _Developing_?

Or do you like _Programming_?
